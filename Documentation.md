### Key Concepts Learned

###  Git Branching
- Created a personal branch (`Elvis`) to work independently without affecting `main`.
- Understood how to create, switch, and push a branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b Elvis
  git push origin Elvis
  ```

---

###  Pulling & Merging
- Merged another teammateâ€™s branch (`origin/Lenga`) into mine to stay up-to-date.
- Resolved a **merge conflict** in `index.html` by combining both our contributions manually.
- Learned about:
  - `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers
  - Cleaning up conflicts and committing the resolution.

---

###  Pull Requests (PRs)
- Opened a pull request to propose merging my changes into `main`.
- Understood the purpose of PRs:
  - Code review
  - Safe collaboration
  - Clear history of work
- Added meaningful titles and descriptions following [Conventional Commits](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13):
  ```bash
  feat: add Elvis's section with avatar and layout consistency
  ```

---

### Reviewers & Assignees
- **Reviewer**: Teammate or instructor who checks and approves the PR.
- **Assignee**: Person responsible for the task (usually myself).
- Learned how to assign these roles within a PR for team clarity.
